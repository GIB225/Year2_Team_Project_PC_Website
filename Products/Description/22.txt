When playing high-resolution, fast-paced games, AMD FreeSync technology with a dynamic refresh rate of 75Hz practically eliminatesÂ screen tearing and stuttering for smooth, fluid motion. You can instantly strike your opponents in Dynamic Action Sync mode without experiencing any display latency. By reducing input lag, it synchronises your senses with real-time visuals in fast-paced games. Even in games where you spend a lot of time in the dark, Black Stabilizer guarantees you complete visual clarity. The darkest parts are matched and brightened so you can spot opponents hiding in the darkness and take them out first.
