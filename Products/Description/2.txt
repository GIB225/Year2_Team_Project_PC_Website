The capability to go up to three years between battery changes allows you to save time, money, 
and the environment. When the battery is low on this wireless mouse, an
indicator light lets you know. With a single spin, you may quickly navigate through documents
and Web pages. You can navigate lists, presentations, and photos with the
accuracy you need when using click-to-click scrolling. Want to instantly navigate from one Web 
page to another? With the Forward/Backward buttons, you'll save a lot 
ofÂ time.
